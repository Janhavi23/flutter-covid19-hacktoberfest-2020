 #Our Proposed Solution
 
                                                       Covid 19 took the world by surprise, leaving world government endeavoring to restrict its spread. Wherein in some countries the situation is well under control others are struggling to stay afloat. With many countries implementing lockdown life has come to screeching halt, not only is the virus targeting the health of citizens but the economy is bearing the burnt as well. Even major economies are struggling to cope the unprecedented demand shock and shutdown of all key economic activities that drive growth. Reports of job losses, unpaid leaves and other concerns are being reported on a daily basis from key sectors, which make up larger portion of Indiaâ€™s GDP.
                                                 Our concern is to develop a platform to spread maximum awareness among the masses regarding the health and economic setbacks being faced by the world. Presenting daily updates and pandemic forecasting estimating the eradication of the virus. Also help people in case they want some necessary items, displaying  all the services which can be used for the same, finding out safe time for people to go out in case of emergencies. We also aim to display the economic changes taking place and the latest actions being implemented by the government in that concern.
